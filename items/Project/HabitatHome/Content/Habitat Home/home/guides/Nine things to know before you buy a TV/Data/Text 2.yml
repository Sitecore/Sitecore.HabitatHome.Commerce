        <p>You might be seeing a lot start to pop up about 4K TVs and the&nbsp;<a href="~/link.aspx?_id=2DA7FF2C8A97CBCC7E4E50724C5B6677&amp;_z=z">Spectra Ultra HD</a>&nbsp;is an excellent example. Just as 1080 was the buzz number when HD TVs were coming into fashion, 4K is simply the next step. A 1080p screen has 1,080 pixels in each vertical column and 1,920 pixels in each horizontal row. The 4K defies the convention by counting the horizontal pixels instead. Of course, if a 4K TV and 1080p TV are the same size, the 4K TV will have notably higher image clarity for everything above&nbsp;1080p resolution. Just keep in mind that a TV being 4K doesn’t mean you should ignore all the other aspects of the TV.</p>
